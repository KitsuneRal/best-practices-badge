Those marked with a "*" have all the necessary rights to
create and close issues, accept proposed changes,
and release versions of software, as well administrate the production system.
This is enough to meet the "access_continuity" criterion.

Karl Fogel not only provided us helpful inputs, but his book
"Producing Open Secure Software" <http://producingoss.com/>
was an important basis for identifying many project best practices - thank you!
